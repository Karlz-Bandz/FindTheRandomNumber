# FindTheRandomNumber


In this simple game you have to first choose the level from 1 to 3.
If you choose 1 the application draws integer numbers from 0 to 10
if choose 2 from 0 to 40
if choose 3 from 0 to 1000

After that the programm ask you:
Please provide the number...

When you provide a wrong number you'll be informed
if this number is smaller or maybe greater than the random 
number.

At the end of the game when you finally find the right number 
you're getting an information that you won! and how many turns 
the game took you
